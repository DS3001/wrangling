    "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the folder, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Wickham is interested in thinking more abstractly about the process of data cleaning, which probably doesn't receive as much attention as it should. Removing `NA`'s is great, but beyond that, what should data look like in order to decide you're done cleaning? He introduces a criteria (each row is an observation, each column is a variable, each type of observational unit is a table) and explore the consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish? \n",
    "  \n",
    "> Despite being a large part of data analysis --- both in terms of the time it requires and the coneceptual effort invested in it --- data cleaning is understudied as a skill or activity. The \"tidy data standard\" is meant to standardize data cleaning. The goal of the standard is to make it easier to clean data, since everyone involved knows what the objective is and the usual steps required to succeed. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "> The idea in the first sentence is that dysfunctional and messy data often present unique or novel problems, while clean data all have similar properties. You have probably experienced this already: Whoever created the data structured it for their purposes or out of convenience, and manipulating it successful within R requires substantial effort. This is a Russian literature joke. The second sentence acknowledges that the idea of a \"Data frame/matrix\" is intuitive -- a row is an observation, a column is a variable -- but in practice, this is a choice that often benefits the analyst if it is made consciously. For example, if you have data for counties by year, what \"are\" your data? An observation is a county-year, which might not be obvious to someone who hasn't played with that kind of data before, who might conclude that an observation is a county; this would lead to a lot of unintentionally bad choices about cleaning and organizing the data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  > A dataset is a collection of values. Values are numeric or categorical/strings. Every value belongs to both a variable and an observation. A variable is a collection of values that measure the same attribute or property (e.g. height, color, temperature, make/model).  An observation is a collection of values that measure it.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
    "  \n",
    "> In tidy data, each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. If data is not tidy, it is messy. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
    "  \n",
    "> 1. Column headers are values (like year), and not variable names. So for example, unemployment by county over time is represented as a matrix where columns are years and rows are counties. The column header is really a numeric like 2012, which is a value, not a variable name, like \"Year\". 2. Multiple variables are stored in one column. For example, month-day-year dates include three things: month, day, and year. Time variables inevitably have to be converted into another kind of format (e.g. normalized to a \"0\" date, and then time measured in numbers of days since day 0). 3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns. 4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table. For example, entrepreneurs/firms, children/parents, workers/firms all get lumped into one big file rather than separate datasets for the two groups. 5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. Data get repeated in an inconvenient way, required subsequent simplification and cleaning. In Table 4, the columns are really values of a \"hidden\" variable, which is income. Since income is actually a variable, you need a new column, `income`, alongside `religion`, and then frequency, as in table 6. Now, the columns are all the names of variables, rather than the values that variables take. Melting a dataset is this process of converting column-value variables into rows.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  > Table 11 has days along the top, which are values. Table 12 melts those days into a single variable, `date`. That still isn't tidy, because the `element` variable contains variable names and not values --- `tmax` and `tmin` are measurements of the same day, which are really names of variables and not values themselves. Table 12(b) is tidy because all the entries are attributes and not variable names.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
    "\n",
    "> What Wickham wants is a broader philosophy of data cleaning. If the tidy framework is just about facilitating certain tools, it's just marketing. Wickham is hoping that the tidy concept isn't just about training people to use ggplot2 effectively, but in creating a bigger and more robust ecosystem of ideas and tools for data science in general.\n"

Older versions of the census tried to ask questions like, \"Which group do you most identify as?\" but it's unclear whether that was effective in gathering information, and researchers probably just used that variable and ignored the nuance of the rest of the information gathered.\n",

    "> For SOGI, the HPS question is probably better overall in 2023. The question about \"assigned at birth\" might be somewhat intrusive and doesn't give options for the respondent to say \"I don't know\" or \"I prefer not to answer\", which is bad practice because it forces the enumerator to enter something. The question then follows up with a more nuanced set of categories that address contemporary discussions about sex and gender. The HPS version isn't perfect, but the ACS/Census version provides no nuance or measurement at all. Likewise, ACS/Census gathers no data on sexuality, but HPS makes an attempt to get information on LGB and S identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I've seen a lot of race questions that only allow one identification and only offer categories of \"White, Black, Asian, Other\" that really lack nuance, so this \"check all that apply\" approach with some broad categories as well as supplementary information seems like a major improvement. Likewise, most surveys have limited options for SOGI data or none, so more nuanced data gathering like the HPS (which isn't perfect, but makes a sincere attempt) will be important in the future; for example, some surveys suggest 16-20% of people under 25 identify as LGBT, even if that number has historically been between 5% to 7%."

    "> I think the biggest problem is probably that we force people into making a \"pie chart\" of who they are without making the meaning of the exercise very explicit. Let's take race, for example. \"What is your race?\" might mean something like, \"Roughly, what percentage of your great grandparents were members of the following groups: White, Black, Asian, Indigenous?\" For example, I am 7/8 Irish and 1/8 German. That is one way to make sense of the question, but seems tied to a historical idea of Americans as immigrants with a specific mix of origination countries. Today, that isn't really how a lot of people think about themselves or their culture, and those great grandparents will themselves have complex, multi-dimensional identities. A person can fully be a member of multiple racial communities, and the appropriate way to let them express that kind of identity is to ask, \"Of the following groups, which do you consider yourself a member?\", close to what the Census is doing. Similarly, when it comes to SOGI questions, it's likewise better to let people pick affiliation or not with a variety of categories, rather than construct a question that forces them into a one-dimensional answer.\n",

Likewise, a \"check at most one\" question with many categories will lead to a categorical variable where you have `A` or `B` or nothing. A \"check all that apply\" question means you have a vector of categories and any combination of ones and zeros is possible, like with race on the Census; this would allow answers of `AB`, `A`, `B`, and nothing. You might want to go even further in some cases, and gather a numeric value that expresses the intensity of association with each category, like $(A=.75, B=.8)$, allowing values to sum to greater than 1, but I doubt any surveys actually do this because it would be hard to elicit these numbers in a consistent and meaningful way.\n",

    "> When there are missing values in race/sex/gender categories, people will be tempted to impute values. However, the people who don't answer these questions probably have a reason for doing so, and using the available to impute values is not responsible because these people are already systematically different from those who answered. For example, if someone has complex ideas about their identity and they opt out of answering, turning around and \"filling in the blanks\" for them based on other demographic data is worse than wrong, because it undermines their agency in deciding not to answer. These kinds of complications have to be considered when you're dealing with self-reported data from people. \n",
    "\n",
    "> My concern when people clean identity-type data is that they'll compress things down to the \"main\" answers and remove all nuance from the discussion (e.g. aggregate all of the identities from Asian [Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and so on] into a single bucket). So the survey goes to a lot of work to gather lots of nuanced data, but then all the nuance might end up erased when it's cleaned to have simple categories for modeling."
